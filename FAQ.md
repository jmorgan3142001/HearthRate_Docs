## Lead Capture

### What is kiosk mode?

Kiosk mode is a touchscreen-friendly sign-in experience for open house visitors. Display it on a tablet at your open house, and visitors can quickly sign in by tapping through a simple form.

### What is a perpetual event?

A perpetual event is an "always-on" lead capture page that never expires. Unlike timed open house events, your perpetual event is available 24/7 for any lead capture needs.

### How do QR codes work?

Each event has a unique QR code that visitors can scan with their phone camera. Scanning takes them directly to your kiosk mode where they can sign in. QR codes never change, so you can print them in bulk.

### What is lead scoring?

HearthRate uses a dual-bucket scoring system:

-   **Deal Score**: Likelihood to make an offer on THIS property
-   **Lead Score**: Likelihood to become a client overall

Scores are calculated based on pre-approval status, timeline, current agent status, and more.

### Where do my leads go?

Leads appear in your Dashboard → Leads page. You can filter, search, and export them to CSV. You can also set up webhook integrations to send leads to your CRM automatically.

## Tours

### What is multiplayer mode?

Multiplayer mode lets multiple household members join the same tour. Each person gets their own magic link and can rate properties independently. You'll see combined scores and identify where partners disagree.

### Can clients rate properties without me?

Yes! Once you share the tour link, clients can rate properties on their own schedule. Perfect for busy couples who can't always tour together.

### What if I lose internet during a tour?

No problem! HearthRate works completely offline. All ratings and notes are saved locally on your device and automatically sync when you're back online.

### How many properties can I add to a tour?

Unlimited! Add as many stops as you need. The tour leaderboard automatically ranks them based on client feedback.

---

## Decision Decks

### What's the difference between tours and decks?

-   **Tours**: For actively viewing properties in person with live feedback
-   **Decks**: For comparing shortlisted properties side-by-side and modeling offers

Think of tours as the "shopping" phase and decks as the "decision" phase.

### Can I model multiple offers on the same property?

Yes! Each property can have multiple scenarios (e.g., full price vs. lower offer, 20% down vs. 10% down). Compare scenarios side-by-side to see monthly payment differences.

### What's included in the affordability calculator?

The calculator shows:

-   Monthly principal & interest
-   Property taxes
-   Homeowners insurance
-   PMI (if down payment < 20%)
-   HOA fees
-   Total monthly payment

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data secure?

Yes! We use:

-   Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
-   Encrypted database storage
-   JWT-based authentication
-   Regular security audits

### Can I export my data?

### Can I delete my account?

Yes. Go to Settings → Data & Privacy → Delete Account. You'll receive a confirmation email before permanent deletion.

### Are you GDPR and CCPA compliant?
